Case Introduction
-
You have been assigned on a project as a build engineer. Project is a solution for embedded systems. Your team members are strong C++ developers who are focused on development of the solution. At the moment they are having difficulties with integration of developed modules. Team has to waste a lot of time on manual activities like checking code style, building, testing and so on.
Team decided to try the Continuous Integration (**CI**) approach and to automate some everyday activities. Your team isn't familiar with CI and they have asked you to prepare proposal which should include documentation and minimum viable product (**MVP**).

Work Description
-
You can find the base git repository [here](https://github.com/PavelShchetska/ci-mvp/tree/master).
Repository structure can be changed any time.
Put your documentation into README.md file. It should be in *markdown* format.

## Tasks
##### 1. You have to prepare development environment which will be based on docker technology and include the next instances:
- Jenkins master
- Jenkins Agent (linux)
- *SonarQube
- Artifactory
- Git (In this case you don't need to run additional container with git, just use github)

**NOTE:**
_Environment is configured and doesn't require additional manual steps from user. (exclude the seed job)_

**Configuration details:**
- Authorization is disabled. If it's impossible to disable authentication use admin user with admin password. Admin is usually available for all services;
- All necessary plugins are installed;
- (*) ะก/ะก++ rules are configured in SonarQube;
- (**) Quality Gates for C/C++ project are configured in SonarQube;
- (***) I can specify the number of Jenkins agents;
- (****) On-demand Jenkins agents

##### 2. Create Jenkins items.
Seed item:
- Configure the seed job manually. Seed job is Jenkins item which is based on [JobDSL plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin);
- * prepare script which will create this via Jenkins API;
- ** The seed job is created automatically (using either shell script or Makefile) and available after running Jenkins. In case of using Makefile the job should be created by calling `make seed-job` command;
- ** The seed job should monitor the repository, take DSL files from ./job folder, generate Jenkins items and execute one after generation.

**Pipeline item:**
Create DSL declaration for Jenkins pipeline item which will work with _Jenkinsfile_ from a repository. [Jenkins pipeline DSL declaration](https://jenkinsci.github.io/job-dsl-plugin/#method/javaposse.jobdsl.dsl.DslFactory.pipelineJob).

Finally you will get two Jenkins items:
- seed item
- pipeline item


##### 3. Automate build process for a project.
- Find C/C++ project at Github (check a license of a project before you start using one). For example, you can take the [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl).
- Implement declarative or scripted pipeline for you project. This pipeline should contain the following steps:
-- checkout project repository
-- build
-- execute unit tests
-- execute `sonar-scanner` and push result into SonarQube
-- prepare build artifact
-- check quality gates in SonarQube; fail job if quality gates are not passed;
-- push the artifact into artifactory
- build results and links to sonar and artifactory should be available on build dashboard in Jenkins.

##### 4. Prepare documentation.
All documentation for your project has to be put into README.md file and written in markdown 

## Acceptance criteria:
- File of docker-compose is prepared and located in git repository;
- The environment is launched via docker-compose. Environment is available and doesn't need additional manual configuration;
- Seed job creation is well-documented in the README.md file. (*seed job is available)
- Seed job after its run creates Pipeline job and triggers it.
- Pipeline job takes project from github and builds, tests, checks and etc.
- Project analysis results are displayed on SonarQube dashboard;
- There's a binary artifact available in Artifactory;
- Build results and links to SonarQube and Artifactory are available on build dashboard in Jenkins.
- Documentation is available.
